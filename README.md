The weather forecast API is free and small cities may not be in the database, as a result it will give you a nearby city.
For example: You type in "Gomel" but you get "Yakubovka". It's a neighborhood in Gomel.

Since the API for weather forecast and the API for autocomplete are different, the option selected in autocomplete may not be found in the database.
